## Overview

- URGE is a game engine compatible with the RGSS 1/2/3 API.
- It uses SDL3 as the underlying library and supports platforms such as Windows, Linux, Android, and WASM/Emscripten.
- It leverages DiligentCore as the rendering RHI, providing support for modern APIs like D3D12 and Vulkan.
- This project is open-source under the BSD-2-Clause license.
- The project style is inspired by The Chromium Project.
- It is inspired by Chromium and RGModern.

## Features

- **Multithreading**: The game logic and rendering logic of the engine are separated into two independent threads, maximizing the utilization of multi-core processors.
- **Modern Graphics APIs**: Thanks to the rendering capabilities of DiligentCore, the engine supports modern graphics APIs like D3D12 and Vulkan, offering better performance compared to the OpenGL family.
- **Cross-platform**: The engine supports platforms such as Windows, Linux, Android, and WASM/Emscripten.
- **High Performance**: The game script layer uses a decoupled approach, allowing integration with CRuby, MRuby, Crystal, and other language backends to maximize script language processing speed.
